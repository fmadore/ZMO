State and Society
This programme area examines how social groups, movements, and networks create, represent, and challenge state and society in their respective regional contexts. In particular, it seeks to explore the factors that contribute to the transformation of social orders. The programme area emphasizes historical analysis, even if it is fundamentally interdisciplinary in nature.

Two research perspectives are at the centre of the discussion: one, a bottom-up perspective which pays attention to local practices and interpretations, and two, the role of memory and memory-culture in the constitution and contestation of social orders.  

The first perspective focuses on local ideas of the state, statehood, and other institutional forms of social and political order, some of which differed greatly from the ideas of centralized state or international actors. The focus is less on discourse analysis than on concrete practices that shape relationships between different groups and between these groups and the state. The translocal approach enables the programme area to understand processes of constitution and disruption of states, nations, and other social and political groups and orders.

Memory and the culture of remembrance enables to explore the wider forms of social engagement with the state, both at the time of constitution of and contestation over state practices as well as retrospectively. The memory of successful, or retrospectively idealized or failed communities or states will play just as important a role as the memory of experienced or perceived (in)justice. Researchers explore how memory is activated to achieve political or civil society mobilization, which in turn is linked to questions that are central to local practices of state functioning and legitimation of a particular social order.

The twin approach helps connect larger group projects with individual ones to develop a productive dialogue within the programme area.


Historical Icons and Representations of the Past
This project examines the making, utilization and impact of the construction of role models in late colonial and post-colonial India. At the center of its inquiry are historical personalities who have been iconized as models. The project emphasizes the process of the making of such figures, which are based on a recourse to history, linking different temporalities to one another, thereby creating references between present and absent times (Landwehr). A central concern is to work out the linkages between role-model constructions and their ensuing historical images (Geschichtsbilder) on the one hand, and, unpacking expectations of an idealized future that are attached to them on the other. The project explores the socio-political conditions under which a historical personality is assigned or denied the epithet of a role model as well as the corresponding motivations behind such processes. How and with which means is the making of icons implemented? This objective not only requires an examination of the producers and recipients of the constructed historical icon but also necessitates investigations into the role of media and materiality. Competing narratives in textual sources are evaluated along with visual material or objects and monuments.

The overarching research questions include: What is the relationship between historical documentation and evidence-based knowledge on the one hand and alienation, transfiguration, heroization on the other? What objectives do historical role models serve for both producers and recipients and how does their story change from an individual biography to a universal source of morality and action? Which processes of valuing, revaluing or devaluing the past become the foundational basis for dealing with role models?


An Oasis Facing Globalisation: The History and Development of Hegra (Saudi Arabia) since the late 19th Century
This project investigates the past 150 years of an oasis which has for centuries been a major station of caravan routes in the north-western Arabian Peninsula. It zooms in on two major transformative events which have reconfigured the relationship of the oasis, its Bedouin neighbours and statehood. The first of these events is the establishment of the Hejaz railway in the early 20th century, the second the current development of the oasis as a major centre for tourism and culture. The project investigates these histories, as well as their representation in local memory and historiography.


Learning to Feel Like a Nation: Nationalism and Emotions in Turkish School Books
How do we learn to think, feel, and act as a member of a nation? How does the sense of national belonging become a part of our common sense? This project explores these hitherto understudied questions by investigating the dynamics of instilling national sentiments into children’s minds in Turkish schools. It analyzes national(ist) narratives in primary- and secondary-school textbooks, which represent the historical and contemporary sociopolitical reality from a nation-centered perspective.

The project focuses on Turkey as a highly-informative case due to its centralized school system, and the unquestionable dominance of a nationalist ideology. It deals especially with the last four decades (1980–2020), during which the country has experienced a transition from a military-overseen secular political regime to an Islamic-conservative one. This enables the researcher to observe continuity, as well as change, in national(ist) narratives during this period of seemingly significant sociopolitical transformation.

By bringing together empirical, methodological, and conceptual contributions from the sociology of knowledge, the history and sociology of emotions, cognitive science, narratology, and nationalism studies, this project aims at shedding new light on the influence of nationalism on our individual and collective minds.


After Authoritarianism: How political thinking travels with Syrians to Germany and Denmark
Focusing on Syrian refugees in Germany and Denmark, the project investigates how memories of life under authoritarian rule in Syria impact subject-formation in new political and social contexts. It does so by exploring how Syrians draw parallels to Syria when they navigate in relation to legal frameworks and authorities in host states.

The project heuristically conceptualizes comparison, exemplification and framing as three key ways in which Syrians activate memories of Syria. In extension of this conceptualization, it examines how specific comparisons shine a new light on what is compared, how examples make it possible to think the general through the particular and how framing enables focus but also limits what comes into view.

The project builds on ethnographic fieldwork among Syrians in Germany and Denmark and aims to develop new knowledge of the processes through which refugees become specific kinds of political subjects in relation to their host communities.


An Anthropological Study of the Impact and Repercussions of Chinese BRI projects in Coastal Kenya
This PhD study seeks to examine the impact and repercussions of recent Chinese Belt-and-Road-Initiative (BRI) projects in Coastal Kenya. The study focuses on major Chinese infrastructure projects including a) the modern standard – gauge railroad (SGR) from coastal city of Mombasa to Nairobi, Kenya’s capital city and b) a deep-water seaport near the historical port-town of Lamu, aimed to serve neighboring landlocked Ethiopia and Southern Sudan. The SGR railroad project (completed in 2018) in fact implemented the cessation of the usage of Mombasa’s deep-sea port for the clearance of all goods and commodities – these were now to be cleared far upcountry in Naivasha. This has aroused a plethora of destructive effects on the income situations and daily lives of coastal residents who used to be reliant on activities around Mombasa port. This project follows related questions and examines multiple ways local residents and communities have been affected by these projects.

The study focuses on the unfolding repercussions and investigates it in its wider historical and political context, especially with a view to Kenya-China relationships. It pursues ethnographic fieldwork, following the perspectives of regional residents, and uses archival work, grounded theory, urban anthropology, and transregional fieldwork in China - in order to connect with all the respective relevant perspectives and narratives. The study focuses on disruption of livelihoods of the coastal population and related forms of disorientation(s). It builds on a strong sense of familiarity with local experiences (among coastals) and transregional visions and interactions (of/with the Chinese), while using translocality and the image of ‘translocal entanglements’ as a heuristic analytic lens.
